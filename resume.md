## Experience

**Research Assistant** (University of Otago)
: Apr 2018 to Oct 2018

Develop real-time interactive voxel based virtual reality software to support future reasearch.

**Vision Systems Engineer** (Scott Technology)
: Mar 2013 to Feb 2017

I developed bespoke computer vision and industrial control software (CUDA, C#) for real-time robotic tracking of live animal movement.
On-site installation and commissioning of vision equipment and software.
Failure mode identification and analysis, and developing solutions.
Notable contributions include:

- Software components which lifted test success rates from 75% to 90%
- Optimization which yielded a 25% improvement in cycle time
